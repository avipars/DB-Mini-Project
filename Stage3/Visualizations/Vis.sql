Vislualizations: The views above lead to queries that we can later represent as visual
plots
Your tasks are:
(1) in pgadmin prepare queries to the views that you created.
(2) Choose two queries and prepare a visual for each. Make note that the visuals are of
different types, e.g., one pie chart and one bar graph.
(3) Copy the plots to the README. Add explanation to the queries that resulted in these
visuals.
